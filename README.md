### What is Banshun?

Banshun is modularity for Spring Framework extension which makes spring more modular. 
Root context nests few children contexts which can interchange by their singletons.

### When I need it?

When you have a modular Spring application and you are not happy with 'import' because:
* Bean name clashes
* AOP clashes
* lack of fail isolation
* dependency loops
* etc
