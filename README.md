### What is Banshun?

Banshun is spring framework extension which makes spring more modular. In a few words it adds an ability to have root context which injects other context in isolated manner in contrast to standard 'import' provided by spring.

### When i need it?

When you have a modular application written in spring and tired of standard spring 'import' problems:
* Bean name clashes
* Problems with AOP
* run or fail entirely
* etc

### Where can i read more about it?
